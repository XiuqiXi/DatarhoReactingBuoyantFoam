# DatarhoReactingBuoyantFoam
Data assimilation for the droplet combustion with buoyancy

These branch tries to apply the low-Mach assumptions to the DatarhoReactingBuoyantFoam for simplifications to reduce the computational resources . 

Moreover, with SIMPLE method to calculate the pressure, the correct boundary conditions are hard to get.
